# daodejing_analyze

A large repository of many small NLP explorations with translations of the Dao De Jing, scraped from https://terebess.hu/english/tao/_index.html

Some of the code is more of a proof of concept as opposed to especially robust models.

Notable sections:
- RNN in model.ipynb
- Using pipelines in python transformers
- doc2vec model found in Cleaning/d2v.ipynb
- scraped data and cleaned datasets available for use
