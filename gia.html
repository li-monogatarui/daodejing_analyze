    <p><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Lao Tsu, an older contemporary of Confucius, was keeper of the imperial archives at Loyang in the province of Honan in the sixth century B.C. All his life he taught that &quot;The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao&quot;; but, according to ancient legend, as he was riding off into the desert to die - sick at heart at the ways of men - he was persuaded by a gatekeeper in northwestern China to write down his teaching for posterity.<br>
      The essence of Taoism is contained in the eighty-one chapters of the book - roughly 5000 words - which have for 2500 years provided one of the major underlying influences in Chinese thought and culture, emerging also in proverbs and folklore. Whereas Confucianism is concerned with day-to-day rules of conduct, Taoism is concern with a more spiritual level of being.</font></p>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">I have three treasures which I hold and keep.<br>
    The first is mercy; the second is economy;<br>
    The third is daring not to be ahead of others.<br>
    From mercy comes courage; from economy comes generosity;<br>
    From humility comes leadership.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Nowadays men shun mercy, but try to be brave;<br>
    They abandon economy, but try to be generous;<br>
    They do not believe in humility, but always try to be first.<br>
    This is certain death.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Mercy brings victory in battle and strength in defense.<br>
    It is the means by which heaven saves and guards.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SIXTY-EIGHT</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A good soldier is not violent.<br>
    A good fighter is not angry.<br>
    A good winner is not vengeful.<br>
    A good employer is humble.<br>
    This is known as the Virtue of not striving.<br>
    This is known as ability to deal with people.<br>
    This since ancient times has been known<br>
    as the ultimate unity with heaven.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SIXTY-NINE</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is a saying among soldiers:<br>
    I dare not make the first move but would rather play the guest;<br>
    I dare not advance an inch but would rather withdraw a foot.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">This is called marching without appearing to move,<br>
    Rolling up your sleeves without showing your arm,<br>
    Capturing the enemy without attacking,<br>
    Being armed without weapons.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is no greater catastrophe than underestimating the enemy.<br>
    By underestimating the enemy, I almost lose what I value.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore when the battle is joined,<br>
    The underdog will win.</font></strong></p>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My words are easy to understand and easy to perform,<br>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">My words have ancient beginnings.<br>
    My actions are disciplined.<br>
    Because men do not understand, they have no knowledge of me.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Those that know me are few;<br>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Knowing ignorance is strength.<br>
    Ignoring knowledge is sickness.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If one is sick of sickness, then one is not sick.<br>
    The sage is not sick because he is sick of sickness.<br>

    Do not harass them at work.<br>
    If you do not interfere, they will not weary of you.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore the sage knows himself but makes no show,<br>
    Has self-respect but is not arrogant.<br>

    A brave and calm man will always preserve life.<br>
    Of these two which is good and which is harmful?<br>
    Some things are not favoured by heaven. Who knows why?<br>
    Even the sage is unsure of this.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Tao of heaven does not strive, and yet it overcomes.<br>
    It does not speak, and yet is answered.<br>
    It does not ask, yet is supplied with all its needs.<br>
    It seems at ease, and yet it follows a plan.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Heaven's net casts wide.<br>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">If men live in constant fear of dying,<br>

    Who will dare to break the law?</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">There is always an official executioner.<br>
    If you try to take his place,<br>
    It is like trying to be a master carpenter and cutting wood.<br>
    If you try to cut wood like a master carpenter,<br>
    you will only hurt your hand.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEVENTY-FIVE</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why are the people starving?<br>
    Because the rulers eat up the money in taxes.<br>
    Therefore the people are starving.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why are the people rebellious?<br>
    Because the rulers interfere too much.<br>
    Therefore they are rebellious.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Why do the people think so little of death?<br>
    Because the rulers demand too much of life.<br>
    Therefore the people take death lightly.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Having little to live on, one knows better than to value life too much.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEVENTY-SIX</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">A man is born gentle and weak.<br>
    At his death he is hard and stiff.<br>
    Green plants are tender and filled with sap.<br>
    At their death they are withered and dry.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore the stiff and unbending is the disciple of death.<br>
    The gentle and yielding is the disciple of life.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Thus an army without flexibility never wins a battle.<br>
    A tree that is unbending is easily broken.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The hard and strong will fall.<br>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEVENTY-SEVEN</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Tao of heaven is like the bending of a bow.<br>

    If the string is too long, it is shortened;<br>
    If there is not enough, it is made longer.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The Tao of heaven is to take from those who have too much<br>

    Man's way is different.<br>
    He takes from those who do not have enough<br>
    to give to those who already have too much.<br>
    What man has more than enough and gives it to the world?<br>
    Only the man of Tao.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Therefore the sage works without recognition.<br>
    He achieves what has to be done without dwelling on it.<br>
    He does not try to show his knowledge.</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">SEVENTY-EIGHT</font></strong></p>
  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">Under heaven nothing is more soft and yielding than water.<br>
    Yet for attacking the solid and strong, nothing is better;<br>
    It has no equal.<br>
    The weak can overcome the strong;<br>
    The supple can overcome the stiff.<br>
    Under heaven everyone knows this,<br>
    Yet no one puts it into practice.<br>
    Therefore the sage says:<br>
    He who takes upon himself the humiliation of the people<br>
    is fit to rule them.<br>
    He who takes upon himself the country's disasters deserves <br>
    to be king of the universe.<br>
    The truth often sounds paradoxical.</font></strong></p>

  <p><strong><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">After a bitter quarrel, some resentment must remain.<br>
    What can one do about it?<br>
    Therefore the sage keeps his half of the bargain<br>

    A man of Virtue performs his part,<br>
    But a man without Virtue requires others to fulfill their obligations.<br>
    The Tao of heaven is impartial.<br>

    The people take death seriously and do not travel far.<br>
    Though they have boats and carriage, no one uses them.<br>
    Though they have armour and weapons, no one displays them.<br>
    Men return to the knotting of rope in place of writing.<br>
    Their food is plain and good, their clothes fine but simple,<br>
    their homes secure;<br>
    They are happy in their ways.<br>
    Though they live within sight of their neighbours,<br>
    And crowing cocks and barking dogs are heard across the way,<br>
