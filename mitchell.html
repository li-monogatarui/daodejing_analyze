<p>Here are some tantalizing excerpts from the newest computer-assisted translation of Lao Tzu's famous
<h1>TAO TE CHIP </h1>
<h3>The Way of the One and the Zero </h3>
<font size="4" face="Times New Roman, Times, serif">Written by <strong>Jeffrey Sorensen</strong>.</font><br>
<p>With all due apology to <strong><font color="#ffffff">Stephen Mitchell</font></strong>, who's translation was the basis for this, and, of course, Lao Tzu.<br>
  This document is not copyrighted and is in the public domain. The author respectfully requests that his attribution and apology be retained during reproduction.
<h2>1 </h2>
The tao that can be <strong>tar </strong>(1)ed <br>
is not the entire Tao. <br>
The PATH that can be specified <br>
is not the full PATH. <br>
<br>
We declare the names <br>
of all variables and functions. <br>
Yet the Tao has no type specifier. <br>
<br>
Dynamically binding, you realize the magic. <br>
Statically binding, you see only the hierarchy. <br>
<br>
Yet magic and hierarchy <br>
arise from the same source, <br>
and this source has a null pointer. <br>
<br>
Reference the NULL within NULL, <br>
it is the gateway to all wizardry. <br>
<h2>2 </h2>
When users see one GUI as beautiful, <br>
other user interfaces become ugly. <br>
When users see some programs as winners, <br>
other programs become lossage. <br>
<br>
Pointers and NULLs reference each other. <br>
High level and assembler depend on each other. <br>
Double and float cast to each other. <br>
High-endian and low-endian define each other. <br>
While and until follow each other. <br>
<br>
Therefore the Guru <br>
programs without doing anything <br>
and teaches without saying anything. <br>
Warnings arise and he lets them come; <br>
processes are swapped and he lets them go. <br>
He has but doesn't <strong>chown </strong>, <br>
acts but doesn't <strong>expect </strong>. <br>
When his work is done, he deletes it. <br>
That is why it lasts forever. <br>
<h2>3 </h2>
When you overesteem great hackers, <br>
more users become cretins. <br>
When you develop encryption, <br>
more users become crackers. <br>
<br>
The Guru leads <br>
by emptying user's minds <br>
and increasing their quotas, <br>
by weakening their ambition <br>
and toughening their resolve. <br>
When users lack knowledge and desire, <br>
management will not try to interfere. <br>
<br>
Practice not-looping, <br>
and everything will fall into place. <br>
<h2>4 </h2>
The Tao is like a glob pattern: <br>
used but never used up. <br>
It is like the <strong>extern void </strong>: <br>
filled with infinite possibilities. <br>
<br>
It is masked but always present. <br>
I don't know who built it. <br>
It came before the first kernel. <br>
<h2>5 </h2>
The Tao doesn't take sides; <br>
it gives birth to both wins and losses. <br>
The Guru doesn't take sides; <br>
she welcomes both hackers and lusers. <br>
<br>
The Tao is like a stack: <br>
the data changes but not the structure. <br>
the more you use it, the deeper it becomes; <br>
the more you talk of it, the less you understand. <br>
<br>
Hold on to the root. <br>
<h2>6 </h2>
The Tao is called the Great Server: <br>
empty yet inexhaustible, <br>
it gives birth to infinite networks. <br>
<br>
Its code is present within you. <br>
You can apply it any way you want. <br>
<h2>9 </h2>
Fill your disk to the brim <br>
and it will fragment. <br>
Keep adding features to your utility <br>
and it will become unusable. <br>
Chase after royalties and license fees <br>
and your heart will never unclench. <br>
Care about a luser's approval <br>
and you will be his prisoner. <br>
<br>
Do your work, then logout. <br>
The only path to serenity. <br>
<h2>12 </h2>
Graphics blind the eyes. <br>
Audio files deafen the ear. <br>
Mouse clicks numb the fingers. <br>
Heuristics weaken the mind. <br>
Options wither the heart. <br>
<br>
The Guru observes the net <br>
but trusts his inner vision. <br>
He allows things to come and go. <br>
His heart is as open as the ether. <br>
<h2>14 </h2>
more, and it can't be read. <br>
find, and it can't be located. <br>
grep, and it can't be scanned. <br>
<br>
In the foreground, it isn't a hog. <br>
In the background, it isn't idle. <br>
Contiguous, unpatchable, <br>
it lives below the realm of logic. <br>
From there it includes all formulas, <br>
an image without a viewer, <br>
virtual, beyond all conception. <br>
<br>
Rewind it and there is no beginning; <br>
Fast forward and there is no end. <br>
You can't know it, but you can be it, <br>
at ease in your own life. <br>
Just realize where you log from: <br>
this is the essence of wisdom. <br>
<h2>15 </h2>
The ancient Wizards were profound and subtle. <br>
Their wisdom was unfathomable. <br>
There is no way to describe it; <br>
all we can do is read their source code. <br>
<br>
They were careful <br>
as someone writing an unbuffered stream. <br>
Alert as a warrior in a dangerous MUD. <br>
Courteous as an anonymous ftp. <br>
Fluid as a morphing face. <br>
Shapable as an interpolated spline. <br>
Receptive as a dialup slip connection. <br>
Clear as a sharpened bitmap. <br>
<br>
Do you have the patience to wait <br>
till the broadcast storm subsides and the net is clear? <br>
Can you mask interrupts <br>
till the right thunk arises by itself? <br>
<br>
The Guru doesn't seek fulfillment. <br>
Not seeking, not throwing exceptions, <br>
she is present, and can welcome all things. <br>
<h2>17 </h2>
When the Guru administers, the users <br>
are hardly aware that he exists. <br>
Next best is a sysop who is loved. <br>
Next, one who is feared. <br>
And worst, one who is despised. <br>
<br>
If you don't trust the users, <br>
you make them untrustworthy. <br>

The Guru doesn't talk, he hacks. <br>
When his work is done, <br>
the users say, "Amazing: <br>
we implemented it, all by ourselves!" <br>
<h2>18 </h2>
When the great Tao is forgotten, <br>
standards and protocols appear. <br>
When management makes initiatives, <br>
the great pretense begins. <br>
When there is no peace in the newsgroup, <br>
bigots spread their theology. <br>
When the system becomes fragmented, <br>
Holy Wars are born. <br>
<h2>19 </h2>
Throw away documentation and manuals, <br>
and users will be a hundred times happier. <br>
Throw away privileges and quotas, <br>
and users will do the Right Thing. <br>
Throw away proprietary and site licenses, <br>
and there won't be any pirating. <br>
<br>
If these three aren't enough, <br>
just stay at your home directory <br>
and let all processes take their course. <br>
<h2>30 </h2>
Whoever relies on the Tao in administrating <br>
doesn't try force issues <br>
or defeat enemies by revoking privilages. <br>
For every hack there is a counterhack. <br>
Flaming, even with a good intention, <br>
will only bring flames in return. <br>
<br>
The Guru does his job <br>
and then signs off. <br>
He understands that the net <br>
is forever beyond his control, <br>
and that trying to dominate events <br>
goes against the current of the Tao. <br>
Because he believes in himself, <br>
he doesn't try to convince others. <br>
Because he is content with himself, <br>
he doesn't need others' approval. <br>
Because he accepts himself, <br>
the whole net accepts him. <br>
<h2>32 </h2>
The Tao can't be perceived. <br>
Smaller than an bit, <br>
it contains uncountable files. <br>
<br>
If powerful men and women <br>
could remain centered in the Tao, <br>
all things would be harmony. <br>
The net would become a paradise. <br>
All users would be at peace, <br>
and the standards would be <br>
those written in their hearts. <br>
<br>
When you have versions and releases, <br>
know that they are provisional. <br>
When you have consortia, <br>
know where their functions should end. <br>
Knowing when to stop, <br>
you can avoid any danger. <br>
<br>
All things end in the Tao <br>
as sendmail flows into the net. <br>
<h2>36 </h2>
If you want to compress something, <br>
you must first pkunzip it. <br>
If you want to get rid of a virus, <br>
you must first allow it to flourish. <br>
If you want to get() something, <br>
you must first allow it to be put() . <br>
This is called the subtle perception <br>
of the way things are. <br>
<br>
Soft mounting overcomes the hard error. <br>
Brute force overcomes the heuristic. <br>
Let your algorithms remain a mystery. <br>
Just show users the results. <br>
<h2>40 </h2>
The return is the function of the Tao. <br>
Responding is the way of the Tao. <br>
<br>
All things begin as source code. <br>
Source code begins with an empty file. <br>
<h2>42 </h2>
The Tao gives birth to One. <br>
One gives birth to One Zero. <br>
One Zero gives birth to One One. <br>
One One gives birth to all things. <br>
<br>
All things have their backs to the input <br>
and stand facing the output. <br>
When output and input combine, <br>
all things achieve harmony. <br>
<br>
Ordinary users hate solitude. <br>
But the Guru makes use of it, <br>
embracing his aloneness, realizing <br>
he is one with cyberspace. <br>
<h2>43 </h2>
A tiny bug in a trivial routine <br>
will overcome a moby system. <br>
That which has no fee <br>
enters where there is no market space. <br>
This shows the value of "AS IS." <br>
<br>
Teaching without manuals, <br>
performing without commands: <br>
that is the Guru's way. <br>
<h2>46 </h2>
When a system is in harmony with the Tao, <br>
the compiler makes applications and utilities. <br>
When a system goes counter to the Tao, <br>
accounting logs fill the root directory. <br>
<br>
There is no greater illusion than fear, <br>
no greater wrong than in preparing to defend yourself, <br>
no greater misfortune than having an enemy. <br>
<br>
Whoever can see through all fear <br>
will always be safe. <br>
<h2>47 </h2>
Without opening a graphics window, <br>
you can open your soul to the net. <br>
Without looking away from the console, <br>
you can see the essence of the Tao. <br>
The more files you access, <br>
the less you hack. <br>
<br>
The Guru accesses without protocols, <br>
finds his man pages without keywords, <br>
optimizes without compiling. <br>
<h2>48 </h2>
In the pursuit of knowledge, <br>
every day something is appended. <br>
In the practice of the Tao, <br>
every day something is truncated. <br>
Less and less do you need to force things, <br>
until finally you arrive at non-looping. <br>
When nothing is done, <br>
nothing is left undone. <br>
<br>
True wizardry can be gained <br>
by letting things go their own way. <br>
It can't be gained by interrupting. <br>
<h2>49 </h2>
The Guru has no mind of her own. <br>
She works with the mind of the users. <br>
<br>
She is good to users who are good. <br>
She is also good to users who aren't good. <br>
This is TRUE goodness. <br>
<br>
She trusts users who are trustworthy. <br>
She also trusts users who aren't trustworthy. <br>
This is TRUE trust. <br>
<br>
The Guru's mind is like free space. <br>
Users don't understand her. <br>
They look to her and wait. <br>
She treats them like child processes. <br>
<h2>54 </h2>
Whoever is planted in the Tao <br>
will not have their account revoked. <br>
Whoever embraces the Tao <br>
will not become obsolete. <br>
Their .signatures will be met with honor <br>
from generation to generation. <br>
<br>
Let the Tao be present in your home <br>
and you will become genuine. <br>
Let it be present in your group <br>
and your group will flourish. <br>
Let it be present in your system <br>
and your system will be an example <br>
to all the systems in the net. <br>
Let it be present in cyberspace <br>
and all cyberspace will sync. <br>
<br>
How do I know this is true? <br>
By accessing myself. <br>
<h2>60 </h2>
Administering a large system <br>
is like frying a small fish. <br>
You spoil it with too much poking. <br>
<br>
Center your system in the Tao <br>
and lossage will have no power. <br>
Not that it isn't there, <br>
but you will be able to step out of its way. <br>
<br>
Give lossage nothing to oppose <br>
and it will disappear by itself. <br>
<h2>68 </h2>
The best MUD player <br>
wants his opponents berserking. <br>
The best consortium partner <br>
lauds the products of his competitor. <br>
The best corporate rep <br>
serves the communal good. <br>
The best sysop <br>
follows the will of the users. <br>
<br>
All of them embody <br>
the virtue of non-contention. <br>
Not that they don't love to compete, <br>
but they do it with the spirit of hack-and-slay. <br>
In this they are like wannabees <br>
and congruent with the Tao. <br>
<h2>70 </h2>
My teachings are easy to grok <br>
and easy to include in your programs. <br>
Yet your neural net will never grasp them, <br>
and if you try to code them, you'll fail. <br>
<br>
My teachings are older than the net. <br>
How can you grep their meaning? <br>
<br>
If you want to know me, <br>
look to your kernel. <br>
<h2>71 </h2>
Not-knowing is true knowledge. <br>
Presuming to know is a bug. <br>
First realize that you are broken; <br>
then you can move toward perfection. <br>
<br>
The Guru is her own debugger. <br>
She has flushed herself of all knowing. <br>
Thus she is truly whole. <br>
<h2>72 </h2>
When they lose their sense of awe, <br>
users turn to religious wars. <br>
When they no longer trust themselves, <br>
they begin to depend upon the authorities. <br>
<br>
Therefore the Guru steps back <br>
so that users won't be confused. <br>
He teaches without instructions, <br>
so that users will have nothing to learn. <br>
<h2>73 </h2>
The Tao is always at ease. <br>
It computes without grinding, <br>
answers without outputing a word, <br>
switches without being signaled, <br>
continues without a program. <br>
<br>
It accesses all cyberspace. <br>
And though it spans many volumes, <br>
is doesn't drop any bytes. <br>
<h2>74 </h2>
If you realize that all code changes, <br>
there is nothing you should try to archive. <br>
If you aren't afraid of hard drive failure, <br>
there is nothing you can't achieve. <br>
<br>
Trying to control the future <br>
is like trying to debug a running kernel. <br>
When you try to debug the system's kernel, <br>
chances are you'll panic and crash. <br>
<h2>75 </h2>
When license fees are too high, <br>
users do things by hand. <br>
When the management is too intrusive, <br>
users lose their spirit. <br>
<br>
Hack for the user's benefit. <br>
Trust them; leave them alone. <br>
<h2>79 </h2>
Failure is an opportunity. <br>
If you blame another user, <br>
there is no end to the blame. <br>
<br>
Therefore the Guru <br>
fulfills her own obligations <br>
and debugs her own code. <br>
She hacks what she needs to do <br>
and demands nothing of her coworkers. <br>
<h2>80 </h2>
If a system is administered wisely, <br>
its users will be content. <br>
They enjoy hacking their code <br>
and don't waste time implementing <br>
labor-saving shell scripts. <br>
Since they dearly love their accounts, <br>
they aren't interested in other machines. <br>
There may be telnet, rlogin, and ftp, <br>
but these don't access any hosts. <br>
There may be an arsenal of cracks and malware, <br>
but nobody ever uses them. <br>
People enjoy reading their mail, <br>
take pleasure in being with their newsgroups, <br>
spend weekends working at their terminals, <br>
delight in the doings at the site. <br>
And even though the next system is so close <br>
that users can hear its keys clicking and biff beeps, <br>
they are content to die of old age <br>
without ever having gone to see it. <br>
