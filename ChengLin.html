          The truth that may be told is not the everlasting Truth.<br>
The name given to a thing is not the everlasting Name.<br>
Nothingness is used to denote the state that existed before the birth of heaven and earth.<br>
Reality is used to denote the state where the multitude of things begins to have a separate existence.<br>
Therefore,<br>
when the mind rests in the state of Nothingness, the enigma can be understood;<br>
when the mind rests in the state of Reality, the bounds can be reached.<br>
These two states, though bearing different names, have a common origin.<br>
Both are mysterious and metaphysical.<br>
They are the most mysterious, and form the gateway to all mysteries.<br>

<br>
As soon as the world regards some thing as beautiful, forthwith also appears ugliness.<br>
As soon as the world regards some deed as good, forthwith also appears evil.<br>
Thus we have the alternation of existence and non-existence;<br>
the succession of the difficult and the easy;<br>
the comparison of the long and the short;<br>
the contrast between the high and the low;<br>
the variation of pitch notes;<br>
the order of precedence and sequence.<br>
The Sage is ever free from artifice, and practises the precept of silence.<br>
He dose things without the desire for control.<br>
He lives without the thought of private ownership.<br>
He gives without the wish for return.<br>
He achieves without claiming credit for himself.<br>
Because he does not claim credit for himself, he is always given credit.<br>

When talents are not esteemed, men will not strive to excel one another.<br>
When wealth is not treasured, men will not attempt to rob one another.<br>
When the objects of sensual satisfaction disappear, men's minds are free from distraction and confusion.<br>
Wherefore the Sage, as regards government, wishes only that it will enable men to be humble at heart, well-fed in body, free from sensuous desires, and strong in physique.<br>
When the people are free of cunning, desires, and artifice, there must be good order.<br>

Truth is the name given to that which was originally nameless and simple.<br>
Though small, the whole world cannot subjugate it.<br>
When the rulers abide by it, all animate creation will of their own accord become their servants.<br>
Because heaven and earth are one with Truth, they produce rains and dews which benefit all mankind alike without their asking.<br>
The name was fabricated by man.<br>
Since it has been given a name, the rulers ought to know it.<br>
When they know it, they will be free from danger.<br>
Truth is to the universe as rivers and seas are to the earth.<br>

The most virtuous is not conscious of being virtuous, and therefore he attains virtue.<br>

The most virtuous abides by inaction, and nothing is left undone.<br>
The least virtuous is always employed with action, and much is left undone.<br>

When righteousness is most highly esteemed, people practise it for their own good.<br>

virtue becomes fashionable when people fail to follow Truth;<br>

Since antiquity the following may be said to have attained Truth:<br>
Heaven, which by Truth is clear.<br>
Earth, which by Truth is secure.<br>
The gods, which by Truth are divine.<br>
The valleys, which by Truth are full.<br>
All animate creation, which by Truth are alive.<br>
The rulers, which by Truth are capable of rectifying the Empire.<br>
Conversely, the following inferences may be stated:<br>
Without that which renders it clear, heaven stands the danger of disruption.<br>
Without that which renders it secure, earth stands the danger of depression.<br>
Without that which renders them divine, the gods stand the danger of impotence.<br>
Without that which renders them full, the valleys stand the danger of desiccation.<br>
Without that which renders them life, all animate creation stand the danger of annihilation.<br>
Without that which renders them capable of rectification, the rulers stand the danger of being overthrown.<br>
Humility forms the basis of honour, just as the low ground forms the foundation of a high elevation.<br>
Wherefore, the sovereigns are content to call themselves "The Virtueless" and "The Unworthy."<br>
Does not this show that they regard humility as a matter of utmost importance?<br>
Hence, the most praiseworthy are indifferent about praise.<br>

In order to govern a large State, one must practise humility.<br>
The father of an Empire should behave as though he were the mother.<br>
The female willing to occupy a subordinate position uses quietude to subjugate the male.<br>
Thus,<br>
when a large State is humble, it can win over the small States;<br>
when a small State is humble, it can win over the large States.<br>
In the case of the large States, humility makes them desirous of protecting all men, and no more.<br>
In the case of the small States, humility makes them desirous of serving all men, and no more.<br>
These obtain what they desire because they practise humility.<br>

Truth is the abode of the whole of creation.<br>
It is treasured by good men, and it should also be treasured by bad men.<br>
Good words enable one to obtain honour, and good conduct enables one to receive respect.<br>
When a man is bad, why should we spurn him?<br>
Wherefore, it is better to advance toward Truth than to be an Emperor, or a Grand Minister, or a royal messenger wearing precious jades and riding in fine carriages.<br>
Why did the ancients esteem Truth?<br>
Was it not for the reason that by following Truth men could obtain what was desirable and avoid what was undesirable?<br>
Because of Truth they could rule the whole Empire.<br>

Abide by inaction.<br>
Do not crave for accomplishment.<br>
Discard learning.<br>
Regard great, small, much and little as the same.<br>
Deal with what is easy as though it were difficult;<br>
with what is trivial as though it were important.<br>
The world's difficult tasks may appear easy in the beginning, just as the world's great achievements may appear small in the beginning.<br>
Because the Sage does not go about great undertakings, he is able to accomplish great things.<br>
He who lightly makes promises will surely be found wanting in good faith.<br>
He who often underestimates difficult tasks will surely be beset with difficulties.<br>
Because the Sage is always aware of the existence of difficulties, he never encounters difficulties.<br>

When chaos has not yet appeared, it is easy to maintain peace.<br>
When portents have not yet appeared, it is easy to devise measures.<br>
When a thing is brittle, it can be easily broken.<br>
When a thing is minute, it can be easily dispersed.<br>
Measures should be adopted to forestall future emergencies.<br>
Action should be taken to safeguard against possible confusion.<br>
A giant tree whose trunk measures several feet in diameter is grown from a tiny seed.<br>
A tall tower nine storeys high is built upon basketfuls of earth.<br>
A long journey of a thousand lii is covered step by step.<br>
Those who try to gain by action are sure to fail;<br>
those who try to hold are sure to lose.<br>
Because the Sage abides by inaction, he does not fail.<br>
Because he does not try to hold, he does not lose.<br>
Men often fail in their undertakings when they are on the verge of success.<br>
If the same care is exercised towards the end as at the beginning, they can never fail.<br>
Wherefore, the Sage has no desires, covets not rarities, and acquires not learning in order that he may avoid the faults of the multitude.<br>
He promotes the spontaneous development of all things, and does not venture to interfere by his own action.<br>

The ancients who knew Truth well did not make the people acquire learning, but kept them in the state of simplicity.<br>
The people become difficult to govern when they are full of wiles.<br>
Therefore,<br>
the ruler who relies on learning does harm to the State;<br>
the ruler who relies not on learning does good to the State.<br>
These two ways are the ways of government.<br>
When one always follows the right course, he acts in accordance with the mysterious Nature.<br>

That the rivers and seas are the lords of all waterways is because they occupy the lowest position, which fact is the cause of their lordship.<br>
Wherefore, he who wishes to be above the people must be content to be at the bottom.<br>
He who wishes to be at the head of the people must be content to be in the rear.<br>
Thus the Sage occupies a superior position, and the people do not find it burdensome.<br>
He occupies a leading position, and the people do not find it irksome.<br>
Therefore the whole Empire takes delight, and is never weary of paying him homage.<br>
Because he himself does not strive for superiority, there is none in this world who can contend with his superiority.<br>

The world thinks that Truth which I describe is so great that it seems unreal.<br>
It seems unreal because it is indeed so great.<br>
If it were considered real, then it must be small.<br>
There are three treasures which I cherish as the most precious.<br>
The first is compassion.<br>
The second is frugality.<br>
The third is humility.<br>
Because of compassion, there is courage.<br>

Perdition will be the lot of those who choose courage, and abandon compassion;<br>
who choose liberality, and abandon frugality;<br>

When there is compassion, one can be victorious in an offensive war, and hold his position in a defensive war.<br>
