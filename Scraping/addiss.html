Tao called Tao is not Tao. Names can name no lasting name. <br>
Nameless: the origin of heaven and earth. Naming: the mother of ten thousand things. <br>
Empty of desire, perceive mystery. Filled with desire, perceive manifestations. <br>
These have the same source, but different names. <br>
Call them both deep - Deep and again deep: the gateway to all mystery. <br>

Recognize beauty and ugliness is born. <br>
Recognize good and evil is born. <br>
Is and Isn't produce each other. Hard depends on easy, Long is tested by short, <br>
High is determined by low, Sound is harmonized by voice, After is followed by before. <br>
Therefore the sage is devoted to non action, Moves without teaching, <br>
Creates ten thousand things without instruction, Lives but does not own, Acts but does not presume, <br>
Accomplishes without taking credit. When no credit is taken, Accomplishment endures. <br>

Don't glorify heroes, And people will not contend. <br>
Don't treasure rare objects, And no one will steal. <br>
Don't display what people desire, And their hearts will not be disturbed. <br>
Therefore, the Sage rules By emptying hearts and filling bellies, By weakening ambitions and strengthening bones; Leads people Away from knowing and wanting; <br>
Deters those who know too much From going too far: <br>
Practices non-action And the natural order is not disrupted. <br>

Tao endures without a name, Yet nothing is left undone. <br>
If kings and lords could possess it, All beings would transform themselves. Transformed, they desire to create; I quiet them through nameless simplicity. Then there is no desire. <br>
No desire is serenity, An the world settles of itself. <br>

High Te? No Te! That's what Te is. Low Te doesn't lack Te; That's what Te is not. <br>
Those highest in Te take no action And don't need to act. Tose lowest in Te take action And do need to act. <br>
Those highest in benevolence take action But don't need to act. Those highest in righteousness take action And do need to act. Those highest in propriety take action And if people don't reciprocate Roll up their sleeves and throw them out. <br>
Therefore Lose Tao And Te follows. Lose Te and benevolence follows. Lose benevolence And righteousness follows. Lose righteousness and propriety follows. <br>
Propriety dilutes loyalty and sincerity: Confusion begins. Foreknowledge glorifies the Tao: Stupidity sets in. <br>

There is a saying in the army: I do not presume to be the master, But become the guest. I do not dare advance an inch, but retreat a foot. <br>
This is called moving without moving, rolling up sleeves without showing your arms, Repelling without opposing, Wielding without a weapon. <br>
There is no disaster greater than Contempt for the enemy. <br>
Contempt for the enemy - what a treasure is lost! Therefore, When the fighting gets hot, Those who grieve will conquer. <br>

My words are very easy to understand, Very easy to practice. No one under heaven can understand them, No one can practice them. <br>
Words have ancestors, Deeds have masters. If people don't understand this, They don't understand me. Few understand me, And that is my value. <br>
Therefore the Sage wears rough clothing And carries Jade inside. <br>

And so is without fault. <br>

When people are not in awe of power, Power becomes great. <br>
Do not intrude into their homes, Do not make their lives weary. If you do not weary them, They will not becoem weary of you. <br>

Courage to dare kills, Courage not to dare saves. One brings profit, one brings harm. <br>
Of these two, one is good, and one is harmful. Some are not favored by heaven. Who knows why? Even the wise consider it a difficult question. <br>
Heaven hates what it hates - Who knows why! Even the Sage finds it difficult. Heaven's Tao does not contend But prevails, Does not speak, But responds, Is not summoned, But arrives, Is utterly still, But plans all actions. <br>
Heaven's net is wide, wide, Loose - But nothing slips through. <br>

If people do not fear death, How dare you threaten them with death? <br>
But if people with a normal fear of death Are about to do something vicious, And I could seize and execute them, Who would dare? <br>
There is always an official executioner. Trying to take the executioner's place, Is like trying to replace a master woodworker - Few would not slice their own hands. <br>

Humans are born soft and weak. They die stiff and strong. <br>
The ten thousand plants and trees Are born soft tender, And die withered and sere. <br>
The stiff and strong Are Death's companions The soft and weak Are Life's companions. <br>
Therefore the strongest armies do not conquer, The greatest trees are cut down. <br>
The strong and great sink down. The soft and weak rise up. <br>

Heaven's Tao Is a stretched bow, Pulling down on the top Pulling up on the bottom. <br>
If it's too much, cut. If it's not enough, Add on to it: Heaven's Tao. <br>
The Human Route Is not like this, Depriving the poor, Offering to the rich. Who has a surplus And still offers it to the world? Only those with Tao. <br>
Therefore the Sage Acts and expects nothing, Accomplishes and does not linger, Has no desire to seem worthy. <br>

Nothing in the world is soft and weak as water. But when attacking the hard and strong Nothing can conquer so easily. <br>
Weak overcomes strong, soft overcomes hard. Everyone knows this, no one attains it. <br>
Therefore the Sage says: Accept a country's filth And become master of its sacred soil. Accepts country's ill fortune And become king under heaven. True words resemble their opposites. <br>

Small country, few people - Hundreds of devices, But none are used. People ponder on death And don't travel far. <br>
They have carriages and boats, But no one goes on board; Weapons and armour, But no one brandishes them. <br>
They use knotted cords for counting. Sweet is their food, Beautiful their clothes, Peaceful their homes, Delightful their customs. <br>
Neighboring countries are so close You can hear their chickens and dogs. But people grow old and die Without needing to come and go. <br>
