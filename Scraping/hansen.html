  To Guide with Names <br>
  To guide what can be guided is not constant guiding. <br>
  To name what can be named is not constant naming. <br>
  'Not-exist' names the beginning (boundary) of the cosmos (Heaven and earth) 
  <br>
  'Exists' names the mother of the ten-thousand natural kinds . <br>
  Thus, to treat 'not-exist' as constant is desiring to use it to view its mysteries. 
  <br>
  To treat 'exists' as constant is desiring to use it to view its manifestations. 
  <br>
  These two emerge together yet have different names. <br>
  'Together'--call that 'obscure. ' 'Obscure' it and it is more obscure. <br>
  . . . the gateway of a crowd of mysteries. <br>

  That the social world knows to deem the beautiful as 'beautiful' simply creates 
  the 'ugly. ' <br>
  That the social world knows to deem worth as 'worthy' simply creates 'worthlessness. 
  ' <br>
  Thus 'exists' and 'not-exists' mutually sprout. 'Difficult' and 'easy' are mutually 
  done. <br>
  'Long' and 'short' are mutually gauged. 'High' and 'low' mutually incline. <br>
  'Sound' and 'tone' mutually blend. 'Before' and 'after' mutually supervene.

  (Pro-sage Commentary:) <br>
  Using this: sages fix social issues without deeming ; administer a 'no words' 
  teaching. <br>
  The ten-thousand natural kinds work by it and don't make phrases. They sprout 
  but don't 'exist'. Deem-act and don't rely on anything. Accomplish their work

  Don't glorify the high-brow: cause people not to wrangle. <br>

  <a name=Kap38></a>38. Consequences for Virtuosity <br>
  Superior virtuosity does not 'virtuosity.' <br>
  For that reason it has virtuosity. <br>
  Inferior virtuosity never forgets 'virtuosity' <br>
  For that reason it lacks virtuosity. <br>
  Superior virtuosity lacks deeming action <br>
  and lacks that with which to deem. <br>
  Inferior virtue deems it <br>
  and has something with which to deem. <br>
  Superior humanity deems it <br>
  and lacks that with which it deems. <br>
  Superior morality deems it <br>
  and has that with which it deems. <br>
  Superior conventionality deem it <br>
  and nothing answers. <br>
  So it raises its arm and throws it. <br>
  Hence we lose the guide and then virtuosity. <br>
  Lose virtuosity and then humanity. <br>
  Lose humanity and then morality. <br>
  Lose morality and then conventionality. <br>
  In general conventionality <br>
  is the thinning of fealty and trustworthiness <br>
  and the forerunner of disorder. <br>
  Those who realize first <br>
  take elaboration of guides <br>
  as the beginning of making them stupid. <br>
  For this reason, mature men <br>
  place emphasis on the thick <br>
  and do not dwell on the thin. <br>
  Place emphasis on the stuff <br>
  and don't dwell on the elaboration. <br>
  So they discard this and choose that. <br>

  Things which from the beginning have achieved oneness: <br>
  Heaven achieves oneness in being clear. <br>
  Earth achieves oneness in stability. <br>
  Energy achieves oneness in spirit. <br>
  Valleys achive oneness in filling. <br>
  The ten-thousand natural kinds achieve oneness in life. <br>
  Fiefholders and Kings achieve oneness in deem-acting to make the social world 
  correct. <br>
  They take it to the extreme. <br>
  When heaven lacks that with which to become clear, <br>
  we're on the point of fearing splitting. <br>
  When earth lacks that with which to become stable, <br>
  we're on the point of fearing spreading out. <br>
  When energy lacks that with which to become spirit, <br>
  we're on the point of fearing death. <br>
  When valleys lack that with which to become full, <br>
  we're on the point of fearing depletion. <br>
  When the ten-thousand natural kinds lack that with which to become alive, <br>
  we're on the point of fearing extinction. <br>
  When fiefholders and kings lack that with which to become noble and exhalted, 
  <br>
  we're on the point of fearing toppling. <br>
  Hence the noble uses the plebeian as its base. <br>
  The high uses the low as its foundation. <br>
  Using this: Feifholders and kings refer to themselves as 'this orphan,' 'this 
  lonely one,' and 'this impoverished one.' <br>
  Is this not taking the plebeian as the base? <br>
  It's not?! <br>
  Hence the extreme of numbering chariots is zero chariots. <br>

  Those in ancient times who were good at deem-acting on a guide <br>

  People's being hard to govern comes from their knowing how to do too much. <br>

  Not to use know-how to govern a state is the blessing of the state. <br>
  Those who know to do these two things are also evaluated models. <br>
  To treat knowing to follow evaluated models as constant, <br>
  This is called obscure virtuosity. <br>

   <br>
  </p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laozi (Lao Tzu: 
  dates uncertain. Speculation ranges from from 600 BC to 200 BC) is, we assume, 
  the author of the Daode Jing (Tao Te Ching), the most beloved and widely translated 
  Chinese philosophical text. The figure of Laozi has always been shrouded in 
  mystery. It deepens the more we discover about the texts. Tradition regarded 
  Laozi as Confucius' (6th Century BC) teacher and the &quot;founder&quot; of 
  Daoism, the &quot;doubt tradition&quot; movement in modern China gave influential 
  arguments for dating the text to the middle &quot;Warring States&quot; period 
  (4th Century BC). The discovery of 1st Century BC version of the text suggested 
  the text was in flux over a long period of time. A. C. Graham argued that the 
  text probably became important only after Zhuangzi died (ca. 295 BC). Scholars 
  in China, on the contrary, have reverted to the traditional dating placing Laozi 
  before Confucius. Many scholars dismiss Laozi as mythological or use his name 
  as shorthand for &quot;the author(s) of the Daode Jing.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The interpretation 
  of the text is complicated by its disputed history and, thus, is even more controversial. 
  There are now over 100 different translations and closer to 2000 commentaries 
  in Chinese. Traditional views are that Laozi inspired Zhuangzi and they together 
  formed a philosophical school known as &quot;Daoism&quot; which inspired a later 
  religion of the same name. Until recently, scholars mostly thought the religion 
  was a distortion of the philosophy, but some now argue that the text emerged 
  first from a religion worshipping the Yellow Emperor along with Laozi (known 
  as Huang-Lao). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We obviously cannot 
  consider all the interpretations here and our interest is more philosophical 
  than religious. We can justify our focus whichever historical story we tell 
  since, as Graham's analysis stressed, the Zhuangzi introduces Laozi into Chinese 
  philosophical discourse. Whatever its dates and origin, Laozi first meant to 
  Chinese philosophy what the school of Zhuangzi first found of interest in it. 
  We will look for the philosophical theory that would best justify Zhuangzi's 
  interest and explain the traditional genealogy. We leave open whether the religious 
  reading came later than the philosophical or preceded it.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We should note 
  that religious interpretations dominate the extant translations. They reverse 
  our strategy here and make the interpretation of Zhuangzi conform to the theory 
  that he was a religious disciple. According to this interpretation, Laozi and 
  later Zhuangzi had some mystical experience-an experience of the indescribable 
  oneness of everything. They changed the meaning of &quot;dao&quot; (tao) from 
  &quot;guiding instructions&quot; and used it to refer to a divine being (on 
  the model of Buddha or mystical creator-God). </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Besides the empirically 
  dubious claims about the mystical experiences and the meaning change, the religious 
  interpretation of the text faces serious difficulties. (1) The mystical reading, 
  &quot;there is a dao which language cannot describe,&quot; describes that very 
  dao and is incoherent on its face. Elaborating further on that dao, as religious 
  readings take the texts to do, is hard to motivate. (2) If we take seriously 
  the claim that language cannot talk about dao, it must rely on a theory of what 
  language can do as much as it does on the concept of the object. We can study 
  that philosophy of language with no threat of incoherence (especially since 
  ordinarily dao refers to a linguistic object-prescriptive discourse). If we 
  can explain the content and character of Laozi's text using its linguistic theory 
  alone, it will undermine any remaining motivation to postulate the mystical 
  experience and accuse Daoists of changing the meaning of they key term in their 
  critique of Confucianism. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Let us start, then, 
  with the historical account in The Zhuangzi. It names Shen Dao as a forerunner 
  of Laozi. Shen Dao's slogan was &quot;abandon knowledge; discard self.&quot; 
  'Knowledge' meant knowledge of some moral dao. He used the notion of a 'Great 
  dao' to refer to the actual course of world history. You will follow it; you 
  need no knowledge of daoguides to follow the Great Dao. &quot;Even a clod of 
  earth, can not miss the dao,&quot; he concluded.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The Zhuangzi account 
  distances both Laozi and Zhuangzi from Shen Dao. The narrator says &quot;[Shen 
  Dao's] is a daoguide that can not daoguide&quot; and characterizes it as a daoguide 
  for the dead, not for the living. The point is that &quot;what will be will 
  be&quot; has no implications for action. Whatever we do will accord with Great 
  Dao, but knowing that does not help me decide what to do. Zhuangzi implicitly 
  diagnosed a deeper paradox in Shen Dao's views. Since it is telling us to do 
  something, Shen Dao's slogan is itself a bit of guiding knowledge. So, if we 
  follow it, we disobey it. If we follow Shen Dao's prescription, we do what prescription 
  itself says not to do. Laozi, however, not only tolerated this paradox, he replicated 
  it. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can understand 
  Laozi, then, as accepting the paradoxical &quot;abandon knowledge&quot; spirit 
  of Shen Dao, but rejecting the fatalism. Something like the Great Dao does surfaces 
  sporadically in the Laozi, but it is not the focus of his theory. He may have 
  tolerated the paradox on the grounds stated in his first line. &quot;No daoguide 
  that can daoguide is a constant daoguide.&quot; Shen Dao's is a constant dao 
  (i.e., natural or not dependent on changeable convention) but it can not guide. 
  Any daoguide that can is changeable.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">That famous opening 
  line is followed by a less noticed parallel-&quot;Any name that can name is 
  not a constant name.&quot; This signals that dao denotes linguistic items-systems 
  of guiding discourse. Laozi is skeptical of the reliability of a discourse dao. 
  The skepticism rests on the conventional (hence changeable) nature of language. 
  No discourse-based instruction will guide reliably in all circumstances because 
  the terms used do not mark distinctions reliably. The contrast of the natural 
  and the conventional pervades the text.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">How does this line 
  of thought lead to the &quot;abandon knowledge&quot; conclusion? What motivates 
  it is the goal of freedom from social control. Laozi treats (prescriptive) knowledge 
  as based on language. Accordingly, knowledge consists of arbitrary, historically 
  &quot;accidental&quot; social systems of making distinctions, guiding desires 
  and acting. Laozi then justifies &quot;abandon knowledge&quot; as a way to recover 
  our natural, authentic, spontaneous human impulses. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Chinese language 
  theories call all characters mingnames. Adjectives and common nouns alike have 
  a scope-they &quot;pick out&quot; a range of reality and exclude the rest. Words 
  are 'names' of their &quot;range of stuff.&quot; Learning a name for X means 
  learning how to make a distinction between X and non-X. We cannot claim mastery 
  of the word 'cat' if we call spiders &quot;cat&quot;. We thus learn X and feinot 
  X together as a single socially shared way to make a distinction. Laozi implies 
  that in learning to apply the distinction and classify things in one way rather 
  than another, we are being socialized into an inherited social design.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Much of this approach 
  to language is common in ancient China. What Laozi adds is that society shapes 
  our desires via words and distinctions. We will not count as having mastered 
  the distinction between beautiful and ugly if we prefer the ugly. Acquiring 
  a &quot;sophisticated&quot; taste molds our desires and shapes our choices and 
  action. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Artificial desires 
  increase strife, first because social structures expand the number of desires 
  and second because the acquired desires are more competitive than natural ones. 
  We would not naturally desire things, for example, simply because they are rare. 
  Socially instilled desires motivate a thirst for status and power. Our natural 
  desires are few and simple. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Finally, the desires 
  lead to weiaction -a term at the center of Laozi's famous wulack weideem:act 
  (non-action) slogan. We teach that the word weido:deem has two meanings-'to 
  act' and 'for the sake of'. Hence, the standard elaboration of Laozi's slogan 
  is that we should not act deliberately or purposefully. We could motivate this 
  conclusion using Buddhist or Western psychology (i.e., desires get in the way 
  of reason), but it is hard to explain why Laozi would recommend being careless 
  or random in action. He has no concept of reason and treats some desires (e.g. 
  for sex, food, leisure, etc.) as acceptable. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Weido:deem has 
  another meaning that explains the slogan better in a Chinese context. Wei is 
  used in the Chinese approximation of belief contexts (&quot;X believes that 
  T is P&quot;). Classical Chinese splits the embedded belief sentence. The (optional) 
  subject (T) comes before the weido:deem and the predicate (P) after. The complete 
  form is: &quot;X with regard to T, weido:deem [it to be] P.&quot; </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">If we understand 
  weido:deem as treating things according to what we deem them to be, we get an 
  insight into Laozi's slogan. It is a corollary of the view that we are to avoid 
  socially instilled distinctions and desires. So ultimately, we should also avoid 
  action based on our training in linguistic distinctions. The objection is to 
  socialization, not rational purpose or deliberation. Laozi indicates that he 
  senses a paradox in wulack weideem:act. He also says &quot;lack&quot; weido:deem 
  and yet lack not- weido:deem. The problem is that we have just learned a guiding 
  concept complete with a distinction, a desire, and a proposed course of action. 
  If we are to avoid wei we must also avoid avoiding wei. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laozi's slogan 
  replicates Shen Dao's &quot;abandon knowledge&quot; paradox (i.e., &quot;abandon 
  knowledge&quot; is itself a bit of [prescriptive] knowledge). The knowledge 
  in question is still &quot;social guidance,&quot; now analyzed as action guided 
  by desires engendered by social distinctions and names. Laozi's motivation is 
  naturalness, spontaneity or freedom from social conventions rather than in fatalism, 
  but the paradox is in the conclusion, not the motivation. The paradox in wulack 
  weido:deem follows a bigger and more interesting circle. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The analysis starts 
  with the concepts of natural/conventional, which it treats as a pivotal distinction. 
  Laozi teaches us a potentially controversial way to draw the distinction (i.e., 
  anything based on 'language' is conventional). It implicitly encourages a preference 
  or desire for being natural and, finally, based on the names, distinctions and 
  desires, it recommends an action. Laozi says, &quot;in pursuit of dao we daily 
  forget.&quot; This forgetting is the weideem:act of getting rid of weideem:act. 
  As long as we do it, we fail to do it. In urging wu-wei we have identified an 
  action and in striving to avoid it, we are doing what it tells us not to. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Zhuangzi abandoned 
  the paradoxical wu-wei position, but accepted the analysis showing how distinctions 
  and desires are &quot;socially constructed.&quot; Laozi's paradox vaguely reminds 
  us of the Buddhist paradox of desire (you must desire to rid yourself of desires). 
  However, Buddhist theory indicts especially the natural desires. We more plausibly 
  interpret Laozi's stance as allowing &quot;pre-social&quot; desires. His position 
  tends toward that of the Confucian nativists, e.g., Mencius. If we can &quot;forget&quot; 
  the learned desires arising from language socialization, we will return to nature. 
  </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The &quot;new born&quot; 
  child does have desires (e.g., for sex, food, and comfort etc.). These and their 
  &quot;purely natural&quot; successors are the desires that underwrite Laozi's 
  &quot;primitive utopia.&quot; A suitably reduced system of desires would sustain 
  social life at the simple agrarian village level but would not generate the 
  &quot;unnatural&quot; ambition to travel and expand one's horizons of knowledge.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The social analysis 
  of knowledge (i.e., discourse guidance) is thus accompanied a conception of 
  innate or natural knowledge (pre-linguistic instinct). This partly gives the 
  text its notorious ambiguity and contradictory character. One finds passages 
  in which knowledge, clarity, and sages are ridiculed and their &quot;accomplishments&quot; 
  pictured as viciously relative. Then other passages speak positively of knowledge, 
  clarity, and sages. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">One philosophical 
  way of reading Laozi can both ameliorates the paradox and the inconsistency. 
  It also gives a coherent role to interesting stylistic and content features 
  of Laozi's philosophical poem. We read the bulk of the text (the political and 
  metaphysical passages) as a heuristic and separate three systems of knowledge. 
  The first system of knowledge consists of conventional guidance or wisdom. Conventional 
  knowledge includes the familiar moral precepts of Confucians (traditionalists) 
  and the systematic utilitarianism of the Mohists (moral reformers). Moralists 
  propose schemes of guidance designed in the hope that everyone in society will 
  learn and follow them. As Laozi noted, these moral systems are based on learning 
  distinctions and using them in choosing actions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Laozi challenges 
  the assumptions behind this &quot;positive&quot; view partly by exhibiting a 
  system we can call the negative Dao. We get this dao by reversing all conventional 
  moral assumptions. Laozi's strategy shows that for key guiding terms, we can 
  choose exactly the opposite of conventional wisdom. He draws the sayings in 
  this &quot;negative dao&quot; from poems, slogans, couplets and aphorisms collected 
  from many sources (and as our textual theory suggests, over a long period of 
  editing). The sources include military stratagems, political cynicism, and Shen 
  Dao's monism. We may even count Daoist primitivism itself as a heuristic example 
  of anti-conventional advice. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This negative dao 
  is Laozi's famous &quot;dao of reversal.&quot; Where Confucian or conventional 
  morality normally values renbenevolence, Laozi notes that tiannature:heaven 
  is not benevolent. We normally value activity, dominance, the upper position, 
  strength and upstanding rigidity. Laozi urges us to see the value of passivity, 
  weakness, the lower position, and receptive yielding. Laozi values dullness 
  over brilliance, ignorance over knowledge, lacking over having, etc.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">These reversals 
  link up easily with the emerging yin-yang, sexual reproduction cosmology. Laozi 
  emphasizes the importance of the female and &quot;draws sustenance from the 
  mother.&quot; He treats the female as the &quot;valley of the world.&quot; Further, 
  yin-yang also metaphorically explains the importance of water with its connection 
  to moisture, the lower position, passivity and overcoming through yielding.</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">On the metaphysical 
  side, where we normally value youhaving:being. Laozi points to the utility of 
  wulacking:non-being. He stresses the usefulness of the emptiness in a cup, a 
  room and, famously, the hub of a wheel. The knowledge we gain from these &quot;reversals&quot; 
  of ordinary value may be called &quot;negative knowledge.&quot; It consists 
  in seeing that the conventional ways of using terms to guide us can be reversed. 
  They are not constant. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">However, we cannot 
  coherently take Laozi to allege that his negative dao is a constant dao. Confucians 
  criticize the &quot;scheming methods&quot; and the disingenuous tone of some 
  of the &quot;negative&quot; advice. Laozi, they charge, urges us to act submissive 
  in order to dominate. He talks of keeping people ignorant, so they can be ruled 
  more easily. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The criticism implies 
  that Laozi surreptitiously clings to the conventional values, e.g., he really 
  aims at domination. We can excuse his doing so if he is trying to make the negative 
  dao seem plausible from our present lights. However, there is a deeper objection. 
  Although he reverses the values, he relies on precisely the same conventional 
  terms and distinctions. Is he still committed to a &quot;constant&quot; dao 
  based on &quot;constant&quot; names?</font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">The strategy is 
  to say that the negative dao is a heuristic. It's point is to get us to see 
  something else. Thus it defends Laozi against these charges. The moral of the 
  reversal is not simply to replace one normative scheme with another. It calls 
  in question the whole idea of having a scheme in the first place, hence of any 
  replacement scheme. Laozi's position might be that the practical &quot;content&quot; 
  of those conventional distinctions lies in the evaluative attitude that accompanies 
  them. The conventional assumption is that they guide us correctly. Hence, if 
  they can be reversed, then the scheme of names is not a &quot;reliable&quot; 
  way to carve things up. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">This conclusion 
  is somewhat implausible. Names and distinctions that reflect real joints and 
  fissures of the world can obviously guide us in different ways in different 
  circumstances. Water is good when we are thirsty and bad when we are drowning. 
  We can help Laozi's case a little if we assume understood Mohism well enough 
  to be appealing to its pragmatic analysis of naming. If the justification of 
  a distinction is only pragmatic success, and if we can show that equal success 
  follows from reversing conventional guidance, this will either calls into question 
  either the distinctions themselves or the strings of guiding discourse using 
  them. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Now, to what guiding 
  system does the heuristic point? What could the third level of knowledge be? 
  Laozi formulates no answer. Part of the genius and appeal of Laozi's philosophical 
  poem is to leave that up to the reader. We can say that it should not simply 
  be an alternative, posited dao. It is more likely that Laozi intended to challenge 
  us to make a &quot;philosophical ascent&quot; to higher level of ethical reflection-to 
  &quot;thinking about thinking.&quot; The most plausible point of the Daode Jing's 
  analysis would be metaethical. It leads us to reflect on the process of proposing 
  rival daos for the purpose of guidance. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">Its thrust seems 
  to be relativist or skeptical. To say that there is no constant dao is to say 
  that any dao will be rest on some scheme of background distinctions and attitudes. 
  All standards consist of distinctions and attitudes which are themselves subject 
  to revision on subsequent reflection. We may decide that Laozi's point is either 
  that there is no way or there are many ways of asking and answering ultimate 
  normative questions. </font></p>
<p><font face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" size="2">We can also see 
  a philosophical role for the religious or mystical reading that dominates translations. 
  The skeptical point of Laozi's analysis of action-guiding distinctions is that 
  there really are none. A mystical answer is practically indistinguishable from 
  the skeptical one. &quot;There is no ultimate criterion of rightness&quot; and 
  &quot;there is an ultimate criterion that says nothing&quot; will be functionally 
  equivalent. Laozi's skeptical overtones emerge in his occasional celebration 
  of &quot;ignorance&quot; or &quot;dullness.&quot; There is wisdom in knowing 
  your not knowing and knowing when to stop. </font></p>
