      There are ways to follow,<br>

  There are names to give,<br>

  Let us call non-being the beginning of the universe<br>

  When we follow non-being<br>
  We approach the wonder of the Way.<br>
  When we follow being<br>
  We approach the farther-end manifestation of the Way.<br>

  We know beauty because there is ugliness.<br>
  We know goodness because there are evils.<br>

  What is long and what is short;<br>
  What is high and what is low;<br>
  What sounds and what resonates;<br>
  And what precedes and what follows.<br>
  The wise do good by doing nothing<br>
  And teach well by teaching nothing.<br>
  Things work without intruding on the natural process,<br>
  Develop and produce without desiring willfully,<br>
  And are successful without feeling success.<br>
  Only those who possess nothing<br>
  Will lose nothing.<br>
