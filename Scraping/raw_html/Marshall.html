   That which can be perceived is not the timeless That. <br>
   That which can be named is not the nameless One. <br>
   <br>
   The source of heaven and earth is without form or substance. <br>
   Naming creates the ten thousand things. <br>
   <br>
   When desire is absent, the mystery is obvious. <br>
   When desire occurs, creation unfolds. <br>
   <br>
   Mystery and creation arise from the same source. <br>
   The source is emptiness. <br>
   Void within void. <br>
  The realm of Tao.</font></strong></p>

   Judging beauty creates ugliness. <br>
   Defining good creates evil. <br>
   All and void arise together. <br>
   <br>
   Hard and soft, <br>
   long and short, <br>
   high and low, <br>
   sound and silence, <br>
   now and then. <br>
   Opposites exist because of each other. <br>
   <br>
   Therefore the sage acts by not-doing and teaches no-thought. <br>
   The ten thousand things arise and vanish without him. <br>
   <br>
   He works without motive, <br>
   indifferent to outcome. <br>
   Because there is no doer, <br>
  his actions are timeless. </font></strong></p>

    A good general is not aggressive. <br>
    A good warrior is not wrathful. <br>
    <br>
    A skillful conqueror does not instigate battle. <br>
    A skillful employer serves those under him. <br>
    <br>
    This is the virtue of not contending. <br>
    This is mastering the strength of others. <br>
  This is being in accord with the principles of heaven.</font></strong><br>

    Skillful warriors have a saying: <br>
&quot;Do not move first, play the guest. <br>
  Do not move forward an inch, retreat a foot.&quot; <br>
    <br>
    This is called advancing without moving. <br>
    Reaching without showing one's arms. <br>
    Capturing without attacking. <br>
    Doing battle without weapons. <br>
    <br>
    There is no greater mistake than underestimating the enemy. <br>
    Underestimating the enemy, I risk losing everything of value. <br>
    <br>
    Thus, when equal opponents are matched, <br>
  the one aware of sorrow will prevail.</font></strong><br>
