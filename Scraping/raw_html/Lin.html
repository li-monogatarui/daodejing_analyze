  The Nameless [non-being] is the origin of heaven and earth;<br>
  The Namable [being] is the mother of all things.<br>

  There is the recognition of subtlety;<br>
  But constantly with desire,<br>
  Only the realization of potentiality.<br>
  The two come from the same source,<br>
  Having different names.<br>
  Both are called mysteries,<br>

  When all in the world recognize beauty as beauty, it is ugliness.<br>
  When they recognize good as good, it is not good.<br>
  Therefore,<br>
  being and non-being beget each other,<br>
  hard and easy complement each other,<br>
  long and short shape each other,<br>
  high and low rely on each other,<br>
  sound and voice harmonize with each other,<br>

  He lets all things rise without dominating them,<br>
  produces without attempting to possess,<br>
  acts without asserting,<br>
  achieves without taking credit.<br>
  And because he does not take credit, it will never leave him.<br>
