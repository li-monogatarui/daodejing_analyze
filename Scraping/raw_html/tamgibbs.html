  Hence, the nation's malefactor is one who uses cleverness to govern. <br>
  While the nation's benefactor is one who does not use cleverness to govern. <br>
  To understand both of these is also to harmonise with an eternal pattern. <br>
  To understand and harmonise with that pattern is called Profound Te. <br>
  Profound Te is so deep, so far-reaching. <br>
  It causes things to return and eventually reach Great Confluence. </strong></font></p>

  Hence, they are kings of the hundred valleys. <br>
  One must speak as if under them; <br>
  That is how the Sage remains over the people without oppressing them. <br>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="Verdana, Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif"><strong>All the world considers my Tao great and unrelated to anything else. <br>
  Precisely because it is so great it is "unrelated to anything else." <br>
  If it were related to other things it would have grown small a long time ago. <br>
  I have three treasures which I possess and maintain securely. <br>
  The first is parental love. <br>
  The second is frugality. <br>
  The third is not daring to be first. <br>
  Possessing parental love, one can be courageous. <br>
  Possessing frugality, one can be generous. <br>
  Not daring to be first, one can lead all "instruments". <br>
  Today, many people reject parental love but desire courage. <br>
  They reject frugality but desire generosity. <br>
  And they reject following but desire to be first. <br>
  This is to court death. Influenced by parental love, the offence will win wars, and the defence will be firm. <br>
  Through the influence of parental love, heaven will provide succour and protection. </strong></font></p>

  A good fighter does not lose his temper. <br>
  Those good at defeating the enemy do not engage them directly. <br>
  One who is good at using men places himself below them. <br>

  It is in accord with most ancient heaven. </strong></font></p>

"I dare not be the aggressor, but rather the defender. <br>
I dare not advance an inch, but would rather retreat a foot." <br>
  This is to move without moving, <br>
  To raise one's fists without showing them, <br>
  To lead the enemy on but against no adversary, <br>
  To wield a weapon but not clash with the enemy's. <br>
  No disaster is greater than taking the enemy lightly. <br>
  If I take the enemy lightly, I am on the verge of losing my treasures. <br>
  Hence, when opposing troops resist each other, the one stung by grief will be the victor. </strong></font></p>

  The Tao of heaven does not contend, yet it easily wins; <br>
  It does not speak, yet gets a good response; <br>

  Who would dare break the law? <br>

  The way of man is not so. <br>
  It takes from the insufficient and adds to the excessive. <br>
