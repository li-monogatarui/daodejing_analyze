  1. <br>
  The Tao that can be told is not the eternal Tao. <br>
  The names that can be given are not the eternal names. <br>
  The Nameless is the origin of heaven and earth. <br>
  The named is the mother of all things. <br>
  Therefore, without intentions, I see the Subtle Essence. <br>
  And with intentions, I see the Manifest Forms. <br>
  These two are the same, though each has many names. <br>
  Both may be called the Mystery. </b></font> </p>

  When we recognize beauty, we find ugliness; <br>
  when we recognize good, we find evil. <br>
  Being and non-being produce each other; <br>
  difficult and easy complete each other; <br>
  long and short contrast each other; <br>
  high and low position each other; <br>
  front and rear accompany each other. <br>
  Thus the sage manages by non-interference, and teaches without words. <br>
  All things flourish without interruption; <br>
  They are created but no one possesses them; <br>
  work is done but no one expects a reward; <br>
  achievements are made but no one claims credit. <br>
  Since no one claims them, achievements are always there. </font> </b> </div>

  3. <br>
  Do not exalt the Best, and allow the people to stop contending. <br>
  Prize no rare objects, and allow the people to stop stealing. <br>
  Display nothing of desire, and let the people's minds be undisturbed. <br>
  Thus the sage rules by: <br>
  Emptying their hearts and filling their bellies. <br>
  Weakening their ambitions and strengthening their bones; <br>
  freeing all from the struggle of knowing and demanding. </font> </b> </div>

  Tao is a hollow vessel; its use is inexhaustible. <br>
  Bottomless, it is the source of all things, <br>
  dulling its sharpness, <br>
  untying its tangles, <br>
  softening its brightness, <br>
  easing its stress. <br>
  It is a deep pool that never dries. <br>
  I do not know whose child it is, <br>
  an image of what existed before the beginning. </font> </b> </div>

  Nature is ruthless: <br>
  It treats everything indifferently. <br>
  The sage is ruthless: <br>
  He treats everyone indifferently. <br>
  How the universe is like a bellows; <br>
  empty, yet it gives a supply that never fails. <br>
  The more it is worked, the more it brings forth. <br>

With even just a scrap of sense, I can walk the Great Way. <br>
The great way is easy to travel on; but we all love to get sidetracked. <br>
We keep elegant palaces and desolate farms; <br>
Our storehouses are meager while fashions abound. <br>
Our swords are sharp, but our senses are dull. <br>
We all have more than we need; who have we taken it from? </font> </b>

Powerful people seem like infants: <br>
Their bones are weak, but their grip is firm. <br>
They are like innocent babies, <br>
getting so turned on, because they have so much power. <br>
They can yell all day long and never lose their voice, <br>
because they have inner harmony. <br>
Harmony is eternal. A raging mind is discordant. </font> </b>

Rule a great nation like you would fry a small fish. <br>
Rule with Tao and evil will have no power. <br>
It is not that evil is not powerful; <br>
it is that its power can no longer be used to harm people. <br>
Then evil will not interfere; as the sage does not interfere. <br>
When opposites no longer harm each other, both are in accord with Tao. </font>

Tao is the storehouse of all things. <br>

the great always starts out trivial. <br>

The sea is the ruler of the rivers, <br>

All the world says: Tao seems so unworthy. <br>
If it did not seem unworthy, it would have perished long ago. <br>
I have three treasures, which I protect and preserve: <br>
The first is tender love. <br>
The second is never too much. <br>
The third is Never be first in the world. <br>
Through love, you have no fear. <br>
Through never-too-much, you always have enough. <br>
Through never-be-first, you remain perfectly useful. <br>
Love is victorious in attack, and invulnerable in defense. <br>
Nature arms with love those it would not see destroyed. </font> </b>

Tao is easy to understand and even easier to practice. <br>
Yet no one knows it, and no one practices it. <br>
Words have an origin, like actions have an origin. <br>
